CDLOD in F#
-----
This repository contains an implementation of CDLOD http://www.vertexasylum.com/downloads/cdlod/cdlod_latest.pdf in F#. CDLOD in short is a QuadTree based LOD with the twist that it avoids seams between LOD levels without mesh stitching by morphing vertices shared by different lod levels at runtime.

Apart from that this repo contains some procedural generation stuff in C# and F#. Generally just a scratchpad trying to replicate cool stuff seen elsewhere.
